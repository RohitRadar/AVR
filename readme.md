## AVR Based Projects
Atmega32a and Arduino Based Projects
### f1_controller
	Code to Control F1 2019 game using two potentiometers for accelerating/decelaration and turning left/right. wasd keys do not act as fine control inputs whereas potentiometers due to their analog nature can be used to give fine inputs.
### freq_ard/freq_meter
	Frequency Counter using Arduino and Atmega32A with LCD interface
### motor_pose
	Stepper Motor control using Keypads and LCD screen. Control can be manual using Keypad or supply of analog voltage to Atmega32A can be used to set position of motor.
