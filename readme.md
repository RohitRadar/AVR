### motor_pose
Stepper Motor control using Keypads and LCD screen. 
Control can be manual using a 4x1 Keypad with key functions:
1. Home:
		Set Motor to 0 Position
2. Up: 
		Rotate 15* clockwise
3. Down:
		Rotate 15* Anticlockwise
4. Analog:
		Switch mode to automatic control. The analog voltage supplied 0-5V sets motor to the specific mapped angle.

### f1_controller
Code to Control F1 2019 game using two potentiometers for accelerating/decelaration and turning left/right. 
I tried to do this for fun as wasd keys in a keyboard do not act as fine control inputs whereas potentiometers due to their analog nature can be used to give fine inputs.

### freq_ard/freq_meter
Frequency Counter using Arduino and Atmega32A with LCD interface
